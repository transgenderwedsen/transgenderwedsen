- my bambistep, bampal, bombu, and dambai skins were all made by my [wife](https://github.com/fastfoodfight). i'm usually always with her and matching as well :-)
- any kind of interaction is totally ok with me (boop, kiss, etc!)
- i have trouble forming sentences so sometimes i might be bad at convo.
- don't copy too heavily off my avatars pleek <3 
- some avatars have trans headcanons: transfem gay dave (she/her), transmasc gay wedsen (he/it)

proshippers, people who make offensive jokes, sexualizers (esp on the safe server), and people weird about dave's disability are getting perm hidden. 

okay thats all <3
